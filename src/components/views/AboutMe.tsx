              Hi!! My name is Williams Mata Rojas, frontEnd and backend
              development üë®‚Äçüíª, i love coding and i really think it&apos;s the
              best profession I could have chosen.
            </h4>
            <br />
            <h5>
              Ever since I can remember, I wanted to be a pilot üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è, which I
              studied for a while but couldn&apos;t pursue. I have always been
              interested in the future and I am a technology lover, which led me
              to programming üíª. I started by studying the basics of HTML, CSS,
              and JavaScript and I love creating things with them.
            </h5>
            <br />
            <h5>
              I have worked on a few projects and then moved on to React, which
              I currently handle very well with NextJS ‚öõ. I learned a lot about
              backend development,starting with expressJS and then advancing to
              NestJS. I enjoy writing TypeScript as typing is crucial in any
              project.
